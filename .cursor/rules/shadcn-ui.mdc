# shadcn/ui Component Usage

This project uses **shadcn/ui** for all UI elements and components.

## Installation

If shadcn/ui is not initialized in the project, use:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Adding Components

To add a specific component that isn't installed yet, use the following command format:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

### Examples:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
npx shadcn@latest add card
npx shadcn@latest add input
npx shadcn@latest add dialog
npx shadcn@latest add form
```

## Component Location

- All shadcn/ui components are located in `src/components/ui/`
- Utility functions are in `src/lib/utils.ts`
- The `cn()` utility function should be used for merging Tailwind classes

## Guidelines

- Always use shadcn/ui components for UI elements
- Do not create custom UI components when a shadcn/ui equivalent exists
- Components can be customized by modifying the files in `src/components/ui/`
- Refer to the [components.json](mdc:components.json) file for project configuration
